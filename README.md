# westernma-syrup

This repo is a way to test various third party tools that make it easier for non-coders to work with GitHub.

Specifically:

* How can people create and comment on issues without getting distracted by all of GitHub's other features?
* Is there a way for people without GitHub accounts to comment on issues?
* How can we make it easier for people unfamiliar with forking, branching, and pull requests to propose changes (especially to text/Markdown files)?
